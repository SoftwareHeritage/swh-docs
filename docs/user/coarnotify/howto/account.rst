   Access to the COAR Notify services is restricted to organizations who signed the
   deposit partner agreement. To learn more about this agreement please write to
   deposit@softwareheritage.org

With the agreement signed and your own COAR Notify server implementation running
you will be able to request an account to access our
`production <https://inbox.softwareheritage.org>`_ and
`staging <https://inbox.staging.swh.network>`_ instances.

Once you have an account, you will get a token to authenticate all calls to our
COAR Notify service.

You are now ready to :doc:`mention`.
