Support the deposit service
===========================

As a non-profit digital commons infrastructure recognized by UNESCO, Software Heritage
ensures the long-term preservation and universal access of software source code,
essential for research reproducibility, innovation, and future scholarship.

Support of Software Heritage by organisations is vital in building a mutualized
infrastructure in service of the society. We are very grateful to all our supporting
organisations worldwide.

We are actively seeking contributions from institutions, foundations, corporations, and
individuals that wish to substantially support our mission. Software Heritage will
officially acknowledge your donation, by various means, according to your sponsorship
level.

How to support
--------------

The `Deposit Interest Group`_ (DIG) brings together stakeholders that are interested in
using, supporting and expanding the Software Heritage infrastructure as the archive of
choice to deposit open-source software artifacts that they produce or use, with
appropriate metadata.

The Deposit Interest Group invites you to join the effort through a dedicated program
and receive acknowledgement in `a dedicated page`_.

1. Infrastructure Development: storage, compute, and network resources to support the
   ever-growing archive
