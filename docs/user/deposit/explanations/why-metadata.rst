Why do we need metadata?
========================

Metadata provides essential context and structure to digital resources, making them
easily discoverable, understandable, reusable, and verifiable. It increases
searchability, enables proper attribution and citation, ensures reproducibility of
research, and preserves the long-term value and significance of resources.

Metadata also supports interoperability between different platforms and systems,
facilitates auditing through clear provenance and licensing information, and promotes
collaboration and knowledge sharing within and across communities. For better
interoperability, Software Heritage has chosen the CodeMeta vocabulary as the metadata
standard used for deposit and indexing.

Without metadata, valuable digital resources could quickly become inaccessible,
misunderstood, or unusable.

The deposit partner is responsible for the provided metadata, ensuring its accuracy,
completeness, and compliance with established standards.
