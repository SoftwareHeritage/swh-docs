Software Heritage listers
*************************

A :term:`lister` is a software component used for the discovering of software origins to
load into the |swh| archive.

Only forges and package managers with listers are enumerated below; see also the
:ref:`user-software-origins` for a list including loaders (eg. for version control
systems).


This page references all available listers and links to their high-level documentation.
