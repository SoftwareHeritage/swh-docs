Software Heritage loaders
*************************

A :term:`loader` is a software component used to ingest content into the |swh| archive.

Only version control systems and package managers with their own loader are enumerated
below; see also the :ref:`user-software-origins` for a list including listers (eg. for
forges and package managers aggregating external packages).


This page references all available loaders and links to their high-level documentation.
