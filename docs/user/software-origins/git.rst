The Git versioning system inspired the |swh| data model, and |swh| fully supports it
on all forges (including :ref:`user-software-origins-cgit`, :ref:`user-software-origins-gitea`, :ref:`user-software-origins-github`, :ref:`user-software-origins-gitlab`,
:ref:`user-software-origins-gogs`, and formerly `Gitorious
<https://www.softwareheritage.org/2016/07/21/gitorious-retrieved/>`__).

Git repositories can also be loaded individually if they are not on any recognized
forge, through the `Save Code Now <https://archive.softwareheritage.org/save/>`__ interface.
