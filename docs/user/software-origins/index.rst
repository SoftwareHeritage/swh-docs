Software Origins
****************

A :term:`loader` is a software component used to ingest content into the |swh| archive.
A :term:`lister` is a software component used for the discovering of software origins to
load into the |swh| archive.

Together, they allow |swh| to archive source code from any forge, package manager (PM),
or Version Control System (VCS).

This page references all available forges/PMs/VCSs supported by |swh| loaders and/or listers,
and links to their high-level documentation.
