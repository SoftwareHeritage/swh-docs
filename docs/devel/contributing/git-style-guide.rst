Git style guide
===============

Various information about how we use Git to develop Software Heritage.

Commit messages
---------------

Good commit messages are essentials in a project as large as Software Heritage.
They are crucial to those who will review your changes and important to anyone else
who will interact with the codebase at a later time. This includes your future self!

Make sure to follow the recommandations from `How to write a Git
commit message <http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_

Closing or referencing issues
-----------------------------

You can reference issues in commit messages (or merge requests). When using the
right formats, GitLab will automatically link or close related issues:

- `Crosslinking issues from commit messages <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/crosslinking_issues.html#from-commit-messages>`_
- `Closing issues automatically <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically>`_
