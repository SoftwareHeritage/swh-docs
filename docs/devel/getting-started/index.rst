Getting started
===============

Software Heritage has developed an infrastructure to collect, preserve,
analyze and present software in source code form.

You can :doc:`learn how to use its public API <api>`. Instead of using
the public archive, you might want to :ref:`use a local installation
<getting-started>` while developing clients.

Contributions to Software Heritageâ€™s own source code
are very much welcome. You will need to take the time to :ref:`setup a
developer environment <developer-setup>` before you can start.

.. this index file is used to force a hierarchy in the toctree,
   even though these two files are in the parent directory
