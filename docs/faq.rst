Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How can I compute my SWHID?
---------------------------

We propose a cli to ease such computation ``swh identify``...

how should I document the code I contribute to SWH?
---------------------------------------------------

Any new feature should include documentation in the form of comments and/or docstrings.
Ideally, they should also be documented in plain English in the repository's `docs/`
folder if relevant to a single package, or in the main `swh-docs` repository if it is a
transversal feature.

What are the minimum system requirements (hardware/software) to run SWH locally?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the `developer setup documentation <https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/developer-setup.html#developer-setup>`__
