Request an account
==================

Becoming a deposit client is very easy, just write to deposit@softwareheritage.org
to setup the deposit partner agreement. With the agreement signed you can follow the
steps below.

For this, as a client, you need to register an account on the swh keycloak
`production <https://archive.softwareheritage.org/oidc/login/>`_
or `staging <https://webapp.staging.swh.network/oidc/login/>`_ instance.

Once you have an account, you should get a set of access credentials as a login and a password (identified as <name> and <pass> in the remaining of this documentation). A deposit account also comes with a “provider URL” which is used by SWH to build the Origin URL of deposits created using this account.
