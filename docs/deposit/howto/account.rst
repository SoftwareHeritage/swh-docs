.. admonition:: Deposit partner agreement
   :class: warning

   Access to the deposit services is restricted to organizations who signed the deposit
   partner agreement. To learn more about this agreement please write to
   deposit@softwareheritage.org

With the agreement signed you will be able to register an account on our
`production <https://archive.softwareheritage.org/oidc/login/>`_ and
`staging <https://webapp.staging.swh.network/oidc/login/>`_ instances.

Once you have an account, you will get a set of access credentials as a login, a
password and a collection name (identified as <username>, <pass> and <collection> in
the remaining of this documentation).

A deposit account also comes with a “provider URL” which is used by SWH to build the Origin URL of deposits created using this account and confirm its ownership.

You are now ready to :ref:`prepare your artefacts and metadata <deposit-prepare>`.
