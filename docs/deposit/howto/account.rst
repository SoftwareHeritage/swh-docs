Request an account
==================

Becoming a deposit client is very easy, just write to deposit@softwareheritage.org
to setup the deposit partner agreement. With the agreement signed you can follow the
steps below.

For this, as a client, you need to register an account on the swh keycloak `production
<https://archive.softwareheritage.org/oidc/login/>`_
or `staging
<https://webapp.staging.swh.network/oidc/login/>`_
instance.
