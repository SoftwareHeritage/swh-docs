   :class: warning

   Access to the deposit services is restricted to organizations who signed the deposit
   partner agreement. To learn more about this agreement please write to
   deposit@softwareheritage.org

With the agreement signed you will be able to register an account on our
`production <https://archive.softwareheritage.org/oidc/login/>`_ and
`staging <https://webapp.staging.swh.network/oidc/login/>`_ instances.

Once you have an account, you will get a set of access credentials as a login, a
password and a collection name (identified as ``USERNAME``, ``PASSWORD`` and
``COLLECTION`` in the remaining of this documentation).

You are now ready to :ref:`prepare your artefacts and metadata <deposit-prepare>`.
