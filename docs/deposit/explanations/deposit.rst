Source code is fragile; it can disappear. It is important to note that software source code has an essential role in research and should be archived properly, alongside data and publications. Software that was built for research as part of the open science ecosystem should be archived, referenced, described and cited.

When depositing in Software Heritage you can describe a software artifact properly with specific metadata properties and it will be safely saved in the universal software archive.
