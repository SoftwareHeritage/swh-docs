What's a metadata-only deposit ?
================================

A client may wish to deposit only metadata about an origin or object already present in the Software Heritage archive.

The metadata-only deposit is a special deposit where no content is provided and the data transferred to Software Heritage is only the metadata about an object in the archive.
