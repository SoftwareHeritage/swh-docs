Tutorial: Best practices when writing SWH docs
==============================================
A tutorial on how to contribute documentation into the Software Heritage world.

Step 1: Identify your audience
------------------------------

#. Ask yourself: Who are the readers of the documentation that you are writing?

In the Software Heritage community we have identified three general types of personas that can be divided into sub-roles:
    * **visitors**: people who want to know what is the SWH initiative and archive
    * **users**: people who want to use the SWH features
	* as a service 
	* as a module by running a local instance
    * **contributors**: people who are contributing to SWH
	* as developers
	* as sys-admins
	* as support r√¥le 

Contributors might be part of the SWH team or external contributors.

#. use the persona type to determine the document's location in step 2
#. add the intended audience on the top of the page to inform the 

Step 2: Determine the location for the documentation
----------------------------------------------------

Information should have a permanent home as documentation. 
Elements that are work in progress can live in the forge on issues or in hedgedoc, but these are not permanent locations.

#. Choose high-level location:
Here is a list of permanent locations:
    * The WordPress website: for visitors
    * The archive web-app: for visitors and users (of the interface or API)
    * The Sphinx docs:
	* *devel* for contributors
	* *sysadm* for sys-admins
	* *users* for users of the infrastructure and all the different services

#. For contributors documentation in devel:
    #. Choose if the subject is a high level (cross-module) section or in a specific module
	* if the document is relative to only one module, go and add it in the /docs directory in the module
	* for cross-module documentation, use the swh-docs repository and the appropriate sub-directory (e.g architecture)
    #. Decide if a subsection is needed with multiple pages (tutorials, how-tos, reference or explanation).

#. For sys-admin (in sysadm folder) and user documentation (in users folder):
    #. Verify if an existing section is already describing the theme that you want to document.
    #. Decide if a subsection is needed with multiple pages (tutorials, how-tos, reference or explanation).


Step 3: Choose the type of documentation
----------------------------------------


We are following Divio's approach with four major types of documentation:
* Tutorial: allowing newcomers to get started and ease the onboarding contributors and users
* How to guide: show how to solve a specific problem in a step-by-step manner. The how to guide is practical to use.
* Reference: theoretical/technical knowledge which is information oriented.
* Explanation: theoretical knowledge which is understanding oriented to analyze, discuss and explain different decisions, including background and context.

.. note::
    We propose using in the following naming scheme depending on the type of document:
        * Tutorial: Tutorial name]
        * How to ...
        * Reference: [Reference name]
        * Explanation: [Explanation name]


Step 4: Create a page or sub-section with multiple pages
--------------------------------------------------------
#. Create a *.rst* file with a short name of your doc in the approriate directory (see step 2).
If this is a sub-section, the first file should be an index.rst file containing the list of the current sub-section's files.

You should follow the empty page template below.
The template starts with a reference, so that you can link to this new page.
The name of the page should follow the scheme from step 3.
Then, you can link to an existing page that already contains nformation about the subject.

Empty page template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: rst
    .. _empty_page:

    Empty page
    ==========

    .. todo::
       This page is a work in progress. For now, please refer to the `existing documentation <https://...>`_.

Empty subsection template 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: rst
    .. _empty_subsection:

    Empty subsection
    ================

    .. toctree::
       :titlesonly:

       tutorial-my-first-tuto
       howto-do-things
       howto-test-stuff
       howto-dance
       reference-info
       reference-best-practices


README in module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We want to reduce redundancy in documentation as much as possible.
The option we should strive for is adding a symlink to docs/README.rst in the repo's module.
Furthermore, docs/README.rst should include docs/index.rst, as following:

.. code-block:: rst
    .. _swh-fuse:

    .. include:: README.rst


    .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 1
       :caption: Overview

       cli
       configuration
       Design notes <design>
       Tutorial <tutorial>

       
Step 5: Add link to page/sub-section from an index.rst
------------------------------------------------------
Add the file-name to the menu of the parent index.rst


Step 6: Commit change for code review
-------------------------------------
You should open a diff for a documentation change following the instructions in :ref:`code-review`
