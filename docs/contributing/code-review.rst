Code Review
===========

This page documents code review practices used for [[Software Heritage]] development.

Guidelines
----------

Please adhere to the following guidelines to perform and obtain code reviews
(CRs) in the context of Software Heritage development:

1. **CRs are strongly recommended** for any non-trivial code change,
   but not mandatory (nor enforced at the VCS level).
2. The CR `workflow <phabricator-arcanist>`_ is implemented using
   Phabricator/Differential.
3. Explicitly **suggest reviewer(s)** when submitting new CR requests:
   either the most knowledgeable person(s) for the target code or the general
   `reviewers <https://forge.softwareheritage.org/project/view/50/>`_
   (which is the `default <https://forge.softwareheritage.org/H18>`_).
4. **Review anything you want**: no matter the suggested reviewer(s),
   feel free to review any outstanding CR.
5. **One LGTM is enough**: feel free to approve any outstanding CR.
6. **Review every day**: CRs should be timely as fellow developers
   will wait for them.
   To make CRs sustainable each developer should strive to dedicate
   a fixed minimum amount of CR time every (work) day.

and practical aspects of code reviews see Good reads below.
